# üóΩ CommunityCare NYC ‚Äì Volunteer Opportunity Insights

This project presents both **static and dynamic visualizations** of New York City volunteer opportunities to support **social good initiatives**. Built for the **HackDavis Open Data Hack**, it helps explore when, where, and how communities engage in volunteer work.

---

## Static Visualizations (Google Colab)

These are quick, high-quality summary charts and heatmaps built using Python and matplotlib/seaborn. They help identify:

- Daily volunteer activity trends
- Event types distribution (ongoing vs one-time)
- Borough-wise event density
- Monthly growth across volunteer categories
- Summary statistics (events, volunteers, categories, etc.)

> These are intended for **Open Data Hack** submission as reproducible and static visuals.

### How to Run Static Visuals in Google Colab

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z8Si88MyFYqJZEVZd1DoaN_73hOLLA6H?usp=sharing).
2. Upload the dataset file:  
   [`nyc-service-volunteer-opportunities.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylerx/nyc-volunteer-opportunities)  
3. Upload the Python notebook or paste the script.
4. Run each cell one by one.
5. Download the generated `.png` files.

üìÅ Output files:
- `summary_stats.png`
- `activity_heatmap.png`
- `category_trends.png`
- `borough_distribution.png`
- `event_types.png`

## Dynamic Dashboard Web App

Built with **React.js** and **Chart.js**, this live dashboard allows:
- üîé Interactive filtering by `Borough` and `Category`
- üìÖ Heatmap of activity like GitHub contribution graph
- üìä Live bar and line charts updating with filters
- üß† Insight into trends for policy-makers or civic leaders

> This version is ideal for embedding into platforms that track community engagement or helping organizations make **data-driven volunteer planning** decisions.

## Usage Scenarios

- üìç Identify under-served boroughs or neighborhoods
- üìÖ Find seasonal spikes in volunteering (e.g., holidays)
- üßë‚Äçüè´ Determine student departments with highest participation (if adapted to UC Davis)
- ü§ù Guide nonprofits in launching more balanced opportunities

---

## Future Work

- Add map-based visualization using `latitude/longitude`
- Enable CSV upload for other datasets like UC Davis
- Enable volunteer recommendation and skill matching
- Add export functionality for reports and insights
- Implement user authentication and role-based access
- Add real-time data updates and notifications
