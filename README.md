# CareConnect ‚Äì Centralized Volunteer Management Platform

**CareConnect** is a volunteer management system built to support community-focused organizations like **NAMI Yolo**. It helps nonprofits recruit, onboard, train, and schedule volunteers with ease. The platform is built for accessibility, especially for organizations currently managing data across multiple spreadsheets and forms.

This submission includes:
- A dynamic **web dashboard** for real-time visual insights into volunteer trends.
- A reproducible **Google Colab notebook** for static data visualizations. (OpenData Hack)
- A publicly accessible dataset used to simulate real-world volunteer data.

## Why CareConnect?

Many mental health and nonprofit organizations rely on **manual, spreadsheet-based workflows** for managing volunteers. This makes it hard to:
- Track training completions and event history
- Match volunteers with relevant tasks
- Analyze community engagement patterns

CareConnect replaces this with an **intuitive platform** accessible to **non-technical staff** and optimized for **social impact**. It centralizes data and empowers admins to make informed decisions through both real-time dashboards and AI-driven insights (planned).

## Hackathon Tracks Alignment

This project was submitted to multiple tracks of HackDavis 2025, including:

- **Best Hack for Social Good** ‚Äì Solving volunteer management for nonprofits like NAMI Yolo
- **Open Data Hack** ‚Äì Uses a public dataset for static and dynamic visualizations
- **NAMI Yolo Challenge** ‚Äì Specifically built around their current spreadsheet-based limitations
- **Best Use of Auth0** ‚Äì Role-based access and authentication
- **Best Use of Cerebras API** ‚Äì Project is using Cerebras API
- **Hackers' Choice Award**

## Open Data Hack Track: Dataset & Visualizations

We did not have access to UC Davis-specific datasets, so we used a **publicly available Kaggle dataset** of NYC volunteer opportunities, which closely mirrors UC Davis volunteer activities.

UC Davis or similar institutions can easily adapt CareConnect for:
- Matching students with on-campus jobs or volunteering roles
- Visualizing department-wise participation
- Making data-driven decisions for outreach and equity

### Static Visualizations

We provide a Python-based notebook for reproducible, high-quality charts submitted as part of the Open Data Hack track.

**Includes:**
- Heatmaps
- Category trends
- Borough distributions
- Volunteer request summaries


## Static Visualizations (Google Colab)

These are quick, high-quality summary charts and heatmaps built using Python and matplotlib/seaborn. They help identify:

- Daily volunteer activity trends
- Event types distribution (ongoing vs one-time)
- Borough-wise event density
- Monthly growth across volunteer categories
- Summary statistics (events, volunteers, categories, etc.)

> These are intended for **Open Data Hack** submission as reproducible and static visuals.

### How to Run Static Visuals in Google Colab

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z8Si88MyFYqJZEVZd1DoaN_73hOLLA6H?usp=sharing).
2. Upload the dataset file:  
   [`nyc-service-volunteer-opportunities.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylerx/nyc-volunteer-opportunities)  
3. Upload the Python notebook or paste the script.
4. Run each cell one by one.
5. Download the generated `.png` files.

üìÅ Output files:
- `summary_stats.png`
- `activity_heatmap.png`
- `category_trends.png`
- `borough_distribution.png`
- `event_types.png`

---

## Dynamic Dashboard Web App

Built with **React.js** and **Chart.js**, this live dashboard allows:
- üîé Interactive filtering by `Borough` and `Category`
- üìÖ Heatmap of activity like GitHub contribution graph
- üìä Live bar and line charts updating with filters
- üß† Insight into trends for policy-makers or civic leaders

> This version is ideal for embedding into platforms that track community engagement or helping organizations make **data-driven volunteer planning** decisions.
